                </div>
                <p class="speakers-data-4">When we choose to purse a career in tech, especially as a developer, we have
                    to accept that we will be learners forever. New languages, frameworks, APIs... New jobs and
                    challenges... There is always something we want or need to learn.

                    We developers are always read to level up.

                    In this talk, I will tell you how you can use our ""forever learning nature"" to teach others, give
                    back to our communities and be better professionals, all at the same time.

                    How, you ask? Creating great content.

                    After this talk you will know Why create content, what to teach about and how to get started with
                    practical steps.</p>

                    We'll dive deep into the objects folder, unpack commits, look at the types of DAG nodes, examine
                    object content, and build a complete visualization of the stored content. We'll also quickly look
                    through Git hooks, Git config, and ref logs. Come experience the zen of git. </p>

                    Components have revolutionised the way we work, as they allow us to invent wheels only once.
                    Executed well, they can save all of the team time. This provides an opportunity for broadening the
                    impact of accessibility, too. This practical talk will go into some strategies for baking
                    accessibility into components, so that more people can use them.

                        development skills</p>
                </div>
                <p class="speakers-data-4"> Every software developer wanders for developer productivity. What if i say
                    as a developer, the only commands you would ever need to deploy your code in production are git
                    commit ; git push. You heard it right, only 2 commands, let GitOps handle the rest. Kubernetes is
                    the industry standard container orchestration tool. Github Actions is the best thing that has
                    happened to GitHub since Git. What do we see in common here ? All of these tools are #1 in their
                    category. What if we can use all of them to achieve 100% automated code shipping, giving developers
                    some free time ? In this talk I will walk you through a live demonstration of how you can ship your
                    lovely application code from your local machine to the kubernetes cluster running anywhere in this
                    universe, fully automated through GitHub Actions. All of this is as easy as writing 1 2 3, trust me.
                    By the end of this presentation, you would have a sound understanding of building a GitOps life
                    cycle of your codebase on Kubernetes. All of these at no cost to you, we will leverage all free
                    options available to us ;)</p>

                    to many different user preferences and situations. Learn how to implement these in forward

                <p class="speakers-data-4">

                    RPA has become popular in helping people automate repetitive tasks they do on a regular basis. While
                    the benefits are clear, the entry level is high - either you get expensive options, tools with a
                    steep learning curve, or lack of support for non-paying users.

                    Ken will introduce TagUI, a fully free and open-source RPA tool. TagUI is created and backed by AI
                    Singapore, a government-funded programme to accelerate AI. Unlike other RPA tools, TagUI uses 20
                    over human languages to represent workflows. It takes just 1 day to start creating and using RPA.

                    There is a Microsoft Word Add-in that lets users create, edit, run, deploy RPA. There is a cloud
                    version running on the free Google Colab. There is a Python version of TagUI that Ken created as a
                    personal side project. There are also community created versions for VS Code, Node-RED and C#.

                    Whatever your background and the stage you are in your life, there is a flavour of TagUI that is
                    designed for you. If there isn't, just tell Ken at the webinar and he'll make sure to work something
                    out that meets your needs.

                    Git Commit Show is the leading online tech conference where <b>senior engineers</b>, researchers,
                    scientists and professors meet while <b>being at home</b>.
                    <br />A 2-day long, online meetup where carefully curated senior developers and researchers share
                    their knowledge and breakthrough projects.
                    <br />Unlike other online conferences, it is fully <b>interactive</b> with opportunities to connect
                    with speakers and fellow attendees <b>face to face</b>.
                    <br />Git Commit Show <b>started in 2019</b> to provide a better alternative to physical conferences
                    by being open, free and inclusive of people who come from remote locations and modest backgrounds.
